    "details": "Matrix arithmetic operations are same as defined in linear algebra. Array operations are executed element by element, both on one-dimensional and multidimensional array.The matrix operators and array operators are differentiated by the period (.) symbol. However, as the addition and subtraction operation is same for matrices and arrays, the operator is same for both cases. The following table gives brief description of the operators "

    "details": "There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages "

A vector is a one-dimensional array and a matrix is a two-dimensional array.We have already discussed vectors and matrices. In this chapter, we will discuss multidimensional arrays.
